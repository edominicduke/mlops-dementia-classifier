## AIPI 510 Module Project 3: MLOps Dementia Classifier

### Project Overview and Goals
Dementia is a progressive syndrome characterized by the multiple cognitive deficits (i.e. memory impairment, reduction in problem solving, and the inability to perform complex actions). Individuals who have from this condition struggle with completing basic activities, making their day-to-day lives a constant struggle. It is a shame that tens of millions of people around the world today suffer from dementia. In response to this, we have developed a full-stack machine learning system that predicts whether a given patient has dementia or not given certain metrics (i.e. M/F, Age, EDUC, SES, MMSE, CDR, eTIV, nWBV, ASF). The goal of this project is to provide a tool that can be used to, as stated earlier, predict whether people have dementia or not so that they can take action early and, in the process, make their lives a little bit better.
